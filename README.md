# swaybar

## TODOs

Readme:

* Explain what this is, "documentation"

General:

* Make icons optional, replace with text when disabled

libs/check-for-updates:

* split of-specific things into their own files
* dist-upgrade for the host
* consider splitting host vs. container into separate "libs" since the host
  may not be running containers at all, the contianer "lib" should be optional
* share common code between host and container "libs"
